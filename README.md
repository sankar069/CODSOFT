# 📌 About the Internship

The C++ Internship by CodSoft is a hands-on, task-based program aimed at enhancing coding skills through practical implementation. The internship focuses on core concepts of C++ and encourages learning through problem-solving and project development.

# 🛠️ Tasks Completed

This repository includes the following tasks:

# Number Guessing Game

A simple game where the program generates a random number and the user guesses it until correct, with feedback given after each attempt.

# Basic Calculator

A console-based calculator supporting basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A two-player console-based game implementation with complete logic for wins, draws, and replays.

Additional tasks such as a To-Do List Manager and an Image Processing Tool may be added based on extra project time and learning goals.

# 🎯 Objective

The goal of this internship is to:

Strengthen my understanding of C++ programming fundamentals
